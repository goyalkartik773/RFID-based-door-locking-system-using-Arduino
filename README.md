# RFID-based-door-locking-system-using-Arduino
An RFID-based door locking system uses an Arduino and an RC522 reader to authenticate RFID cards. When a valid card UID is detected, Arduino triggers a servo/solenoid lock to open the door. Invalid cards are rejected, making it a secure, low-cost and contactless access control system.
